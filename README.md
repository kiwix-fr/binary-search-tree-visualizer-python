# Binary Search Tree Visualizer

This project is an interactive Python application that visualizes Binary Search Trees (BST) using **Tkinter**. It allows users to see the structure of a BST as nodes are added, removed, or rearranged in real-time.

## Features
- **Visualize Tree Structure:** Displays nodes and connections of a BST graphically.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Automatically updates the visualization as changes are made to the tree.
- **Interactive UI Tabs:** Separate sections for editing the tree, viewing tree info, and executing commands.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (typically included with Python)
- Be sure to have the 3 files in the same folder

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Ensure Tkinter is available in your environment.
3. Run the script using: python binary_search_tree_visualizer.py
